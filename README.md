# isdp
This repository is a compilation of topics and concerns related to Information Security and Data Privacy (ISDP), with some examples. Everything is accessible in the public domain. The content below can be structured better, and I am looking for assistance on this, for now, compiling self-notes for a course under construction 🙂    

The importance and relevancy of cybersecurity are ever-increasing and can be in every walk of life around us. News headlines fill our screens, reporting yet another hack or data leak. How often do we pay attention before submitting data to websites or mobile apps?     

Cybersecurity is relevant to everyone in the modern world, including a strong password policy to protect individual accounts at workplaces. Organizations must protect individual's personal data from accidental leakage.    

Note:- You get to be aware of constant surveillance, not just web browsers, data trackers, and over-privileged apps, but even cameras around you. Good cameras can watch you and your screen activities! Speak up for data collection minimization.

## Shannon's Maxim 
Shannon's Maxim => _We should always assume that the enemy will fully know how our system works._    
rks101: So, can we make it easy, make it explicit? to make better, break better, and defend better?    

---- 

## CIA and DAD    

CIA triad is a model that guides security policies for information security. CIA triad refers to an information system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.      

The attackers or adversaries have a mindset of another countering approach - the DAD triad that refers to disclosure, alteration, and denial of information.    

[DAD](https://library.mosse-institute.com/articles/2022/05/the-attacker-mindset-the-dad-triad/the-attacker-mindset-the-dad-triad.html)     

---- 

## OSINT 
We hear about OSINT => _Open Source INTelligence_ often in the context of information security and data privacy to gather data stealthily or by knocking on the servers' doors.    

**Passive Reconnaissance** => Your queries or packets are going to umpteen resources available on the public internet to anyone willing to query, and they are not going to your target’s environment or network. e.g., using the whois database query or DNS query for a domain    

**OSINT** => Passive reconnaissance and intelligence gathered using your target’s resources explicitly meant for public use as to a potential user, role, or affiliate. e.g., sslscan or curl query for a domain.    

[A few sources of OSINT](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/osint-open-source-intelligence/) - published studies, research papers, news articles, public data repositories, survey data, data released by government agencies, voluntary disclosures, leaked data online, archives of historical data, etc.

You can check your website's HTTP **response headers** at [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/)   

For a top-graded website and W3C compliance, set the following HTTP headers to suitable values:    
Strict-Transport-Security <== HSTS   
X-Frame-Options   
X-Content-Type-Options   
Content-Security-Policy     
Referrer-Policy   
Permissions-Policy    

Every sysad and webmaster should consider [hardening HTTP response headers](https://scotthelme.co.uk/hardening-your-http-response-headers/).   

Some suggestions for [Apache server hardening](https://www.tecmint.com/apache-security-tips/)    

[Check your browser's support for Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://wpt.live/subresource-integrity/subresource-integrity.html), [what is Subresource Integrity(SRI)](https://www.srihash.org/) - It ensures your resources hosted on 3rd-party servers are not tampered with using libraries.

## SSL TLS Certificates 

[TLS v1.3](https://sectigostore.com/blog/tls-version-1-3-what-to-know-about-the-latest-tls-version/), [TLS v1.3 RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446) released in August 2018    

[Browser support or compatibility matrix for TLS v1.3](https://caniuse.com/tls1-3). You can upgrade your web browser once, and you should be fine for SSL compatibility.   

[TLS versions](https://www.covetus.com/blog/different-versions-of-transfer-layer-security-tls-its-working-and-benefits)   
[TLS versions comparison](https://thesecmaster.com/what-is-ssl-tls-how-ssl-tls-1-2-and-tls-1-3-differ-from-each-other/)    

[Enable/Disable TLS versions on popular servers](https://thesecmaster.com/how-to-enable-tls-1-3-on-popular-web-servers/) and [disable older TLS versions](https://www.ssl.com/guide/disable-tls-1-0-and-1-1-apache-nginx/)   

To disable obsolete versions of SSL/TLS supported by Apache on Ubuntu, specify them as follows in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ssl.conf, e.g.:
```
SSLProtocol all -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1
```
and to allow TLSv1.2 and v1.3 only:   
```
SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1.2 +TLSv1.3
```

Finally, check the sslscan output, TLS certificate checks like the one by [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest) and [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/help/) for TLS certs, and some basic vulnerability checks.   

[Understand Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and Certificate Revokation](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/ocsp-ocsp-stapling-ocsp-must-staple/)    

On the client side, do not ignore [SSL/TLS Certificate Errors and ways to address them](https://sematext.com/blog/ssl-certificate-error/)   

For **SendGrid domain whitelisting** validation error [check Top-Level-Domain auto-appending](https://web.archive.org/web/20170706082258/https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Troubleshooting/Authentication/i_have_created_dns_records_but_the_whitelabel_wizard_is_not_validating_them.html). You should check existing entries in DNS too.   

[SSL and TLS Deployment Best Practices](https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices)    

**System upgrade: You may need to upgrade the Apache server to v2.4.38 or higher, open SSL to v1.1.1 or higher, and Ubuntu OS for TLS v1.3    

Notes:-    
* SSL/TLS Certificates are valid for a maximum of 398 days. You should take care of the time zone if the issuer is not in the same time zone as the host.    
* Paid TLS certificates do not use better cryptography than free certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt). Paid TLS can give you extended validity on certificates.    
* Subject Alternate Name (SAN) or multi-domain TLS certificates allow additional host names to be protected by the same /single TLS certificate when creating the certificate.   
* Apache allows you to virtually host multiple HTTPS sites with a single public IP address using SAN certificates.    
* Wildcard certificate can protect all sub-domains of the same suffix top-level domain (TLD), e.g., *.mydomain.com - while for *.mydomain.org, you need a separate certificate.   
* SSL is only referred to for historical reasons. Most SSL/TLS certificates currently use TLS v1.2 / v1.3.   
* Web browsers have a hardcoded list of trusted certificate authorities (CA) to check that your certificate is signed by someone it trusts.   
* You can make a "self-signed" TLS certificate. Because a trusted certificate authority does not sign that certificate, browsers won't accept it.

Using `openssl` for SSL/TLS certificates    

e.g., check if a remote server uses TLSv1.2 - if you get the certificate chain back, it's all good.    
```

## Encode Decode    

Common encoding types are base32, which converts binary data to the string of characters A-Z and 2-7, and base64, which converts using the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, +, / and the equals sign used for padding.   
[Base64 Encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/)     

Encoding and encryption are two different things.    

**Rainbow tables**: Online tools can help retrieve an original message from a hash using rainbow tables of stored hashes and messages.    

[crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net/) to try Hash cracker/resolver.    

[AES encryption decryption online tools](https://devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption)    

[MD5 and many more hashes](https://md5hashing.net/) to decode the message.    

[hashcat](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) provides example hashes.     

----

## Weak Links 

Web browsers and passwords remain a weak link in the overall security posture.    

One should avoid [common or weak passwords](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/passwords-passwords-everywhere) in personal accounts and accounts at organizations/workplaces.     

[How common is the password-reuse problem?](https://www.troyhunt.com/only-secure-password-is-one-you-cant/)    


**Philosophy of a good and secure password**    

A secure password is the one:     
- you cannot remember    
- you can retrieve it - with what you know and what you have     
- you never shared over wire/network, and the application never displays you back *^ 
- you never shared with anyone     
- you never wrote in email drafts/notebook/online accounts     
- you never reused it on multiple sites     
- you never reused it on other sites with varying one or two digits/characters
  
*^ (Be careful when you type your passwords/PINs because Cameras watch you at 3 meters in offices (and cannot stop thefts), ATMs, public places, and wherever not. Who cares about your mental health or privacy?)

## Cyber Threat Intelligence   

There are databases and organizations that provide a lot of data about cyber threats, incidents that occurred, and models to analyze threats.     

MITRE, OWASP, etc, have some known databases that can provide ample cyber threat intelligence.    

[OWASP top ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)    

[MITRE ATT&CK matrix for enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/). Several other [ATT&CK matrices](https://attack.mitre.org/docs/ATTACK_Design_and_Philosophy_March_2020.pdf)  are published on Windows, macOS, Linux, Cloud, Mobile, etc., for categorization of adversary behavior.     

---- 

## Cyber Kill Chain    

[Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html) is a framework developed by Lockheed Martin under Intelligence Driven Defence for identifying and preventing cyber intrusions. The framework/model identifies what the adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objective.     

Cyber Kill Chain has seven steps:     

**Recon** (reconnaissance): Recon refers to activities where the attacker tries to learn as much as possible about the target - the types of servers, operating systems, IP addresses, names of users, harvesting email addresses, and anything that can help the attack’s success.    

**Weaponization**: This step refers to coupling exploit or preparing a file with a malicious component, for example, to provide the attacker with remote access.    

**Delivery**: Delivery means delivering the “weaponized” bundle or file to the target via any feasible method, e.g., email, web hyperlink, or USB flash drive.    

**Exploitation**: When users open the malicious bundle or file, their target system executes the malicious component.    

**Installation**: This step should install the malicious component on the target assets to unleash mayhem.    

**Command & Control (C2)**: The successful installation of the malware provides the attacker with a command and control ability over the target system. This is like remotely monitoring and watching the exploit play.    

**Actions on Objectives**: After gaining control over one target system (Hands-on-Keyboard access), the attacker has achieved their objectives. One example objective is Data Exfiltration (stealing target asset’s data).    

---- 

## Hands-on    

At times, creating and fiddling with environment setup is fun, learning, and hell yes, time-consuming. These days, you can try out online environments or playgrounds without the need to install and create complex setups. So, for those who cannot afford an environment, or system or are too lazy to set up one, browser-based online learning kits are available.     

[SEED Labs](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/) - grateful to receive (hard copy) labs from Professor Wenliang Du, Syracuse University.   

[Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com) - gives virtual rooms or environments accessible from within the web browser to try out a few things.

### Data Brokers and Trackers    

A data broker can be defined as a business/entity that knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship. The country-specific laws can exempt some of these entities. Exempted businesses/entities may include consumer reporting agencies - credit bureaus, certain financial institutions, and insurance companies. e.g., In India CIBIL, CCI, NeSL, etc. may be exempted.

[Windows 11/10 App Permissions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/app-permissions-aea98a7c-b61a-1930-6ed0-47f0ed2ee15c)    
- What comes as a surprise to us is why and when it became normal to give permissions like "Allow elevation" and "App diagnostics"!     
- While tech companies, collect and share data, are they alone going to control and dictate terms of privacy and security?     
- Data exfiltration at the cost of using the so-called free apps and implicit consent to "Terms and Conditions" users do not read or are not shown prominently!    

---- 

## Android App Permissions     

We have conducted three separate studies and we show apps are not transparent about permissions being asked from users and permissions being used in practice!     

These studies voice our growing concerns over what an app says (looking at its application description) and what discrepancies are found when we look at permissions available to the app and what is being used inside the binary code of the app. Digital Personal Data exfiltration happens at the cost of using the so-called free app and implicit/deemed consent to "Terms and Conditions" of users do not read them or these T&Cs are not shown prominently! It has become more difficult to locate permission details than before.

## Quiz   

Q1. In 1942, the US government passed the Victory Act, causing the top tax rate to skyrocket to 88 percent, which rose to 94 percent in 1944 due to various surtaxes. The top tax rate in Britain rose as high as 98 percent in the 1940s. In Germany, the top tax rate climbed to 64.99 percent in 1941. What was the top tax rate in Ukraine, which was engulfed in war for over two years during 2022-24? Why?     

Q2. In India, B. Tech. Undergraduate students take 60 to 70 courses (theory, labs, projects) over four years, amounting to 120 to 160 credits as per degree requirements. How many courses does one remember for the longest time? Count yours :) After working for ten years in one or two industries, what courses s/he misses the most that should have been taught in the first college degree?
